# WW-Cover-Letter
A cover letter in the form of an HTML and inline CSS email.

<p>Hi there! Here's some information on my reasoning when designing and coding this email:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I resized the banner to 550px, as typically emails should not extend beyond a width of 600px. I left some breathing room of ~50px in case some email clients and browsers I did not have access to would render it differently.</li>
  <li>The email is coded with inline CSS (rather than an external CSS sheet, which never works in email, and internal CSS styling, which can be tricky). Inline CSS code looks messy when viewing the source, but the result is the same and it is the safest way to code emails.</li>
  <li>Similarly, the format consists of tables, rather than &lt;div&gt; tags. This makes it harder to form responsive emails (though not impossible), but is also a safer method to make sure the email actually is formatted correctly. Therefore, I took a safer route with this email as I wanted to make sure the information would actually show up.</li>
  <li>All images were resized proportionally using Adobe Photoshop, and the entire template was taken from a PDF design that I created in Adobe InDesign.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other paths that could be taken when designing emails and I am always open to collaboration. This was just a short look at my personal thought process when creating this email.</p>
